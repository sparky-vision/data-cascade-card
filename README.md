A data cascade element for HA-LCARS

Well well nerds, who would have expected I would EVER be able to do anything like this? Nobody, that's who.

I've wanted an element that could do the LCARS "data cascade" for a while, but have it display actually-useful information, like the states of various entities from Home Assistant. So, I made my own.
